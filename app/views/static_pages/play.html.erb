        <ul class='rules-list'>
          <li>A cell is 'living' if it is colored in. A cell is 'dead' if it is blank. You can bring to life cells by clicking in them.</li>
          <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.</li>
          <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
          <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.</li>
          <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
